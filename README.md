# Rarity

Application instance using the (applejacks framework)[/johnCision/applejacks] with backend service vis (spike)[/johnCision/spike]


## assets

Assets (CSS / Icons / Fonts) are aquired via (rarity-assets)[/johnCision/rarity-assets] and "intsalled" via the `npm run build` command.
(note this is not ideal.  it is a manual step that could bue automated via a build toolchain, or via the package `postintall` lifecycle step.  this "binding" should be codified)
